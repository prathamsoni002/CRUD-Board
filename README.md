# CRUD Board: Empowering Seamless Collaboration and Communication

CRUD Board is a web application that revolutionizes group conversations and information sharing. With CRUD Board, users can create and join conversation groups, referred to as "Boards." Within these Boards, users can post Statements, along with detailed descriptions, to provide context and engage effectively.

## Features

- **Create and Join Boards**: Users can create or join conversation groups (Boards) to collaborate with others on specific topics or projects.

- **Post Statements with Descriptions**: Users can post Statements, along with detailed descriptions, to provide context and clarity.

- **Dynamic Viewing**: Statements are visible to all users, but additional details are revealed when a Statement is clicked, promoting organized and clutter-free discussions.

- **CRUD Operations**: Users have complete authority over their own Statements, allowing them to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their contributions.

- **Update History**: The latest Update history is visible from the very first update after the original statement is published.

## Usage

To use CRUD Board, you will need to sign up for an account on the platform. Once logged in, you can start creating Boards and posting Statements to facilitate smooth communication and collaboration within your groups.

## Why it was made

The idea for CRUD Board came from observing conversations with colleagues. I noticed that some members ignored certain topics, while others sought more information. CRUD Board aims to enhance group conversations by allowing users to post Statements with detailed descriptions. Users have the authority to update and correct their Statements, while others can choose to view additional details or not. This concept provides a user-friendly web interface, promoting meaningful interactions and organized discussions within groups.
